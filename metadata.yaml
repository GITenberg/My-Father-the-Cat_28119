description: Henry Slesar, as we have said before, is a young advertising executive
  who has rapidly become one of the better known writers in the field. Here is an
  off-trail story that is guaranteed to make some of you take a very searching second
  look at some of the young men you know. ""He wondered if I'd told her everything,
  and, faltering, I had to admit that I hadn't. She was wonderful-but human.""
